import Foundation


//SETS:
// ordered sets can be implemented with binary search tree (or AVL BST for better lookup performance, which is more ideal)
// unordered sets can be implemented with hash table backing


//PRIORITY QUEUE:
// can be implemented with a max heap data structure (rather than a linked list) so that finding the "highest priority" object to process is simple (and O(1) time complexity) since it will always be the "top" (or root) node of the heap

//"DEQUE":
// a queue that can have objects at either end "dequeued" and processed; implemented via a DOUBLY linked list (or array)
